## üìå Description
This repository contains tools and scripts for evaluating the **meteorological and hydrological performance** of two radar-based nowcasting models released by [Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK)](https://www.fbk.eu/):

- **LDCast**
- **GPTCast**

The evaluation is carried out on two significant rainfall events over the **Seveso River Basin (Milan Hydraulic Node)**:
- **14‚Äì15 September 2023**
- **31 October‚Äì1 November 2023**

The repository includes methods for:
- Meteorological skill score calculation (e.g. CRPS, FSS, SAL)
- Hydrological validation with rainfall‚Äìrunoff modeling
- Visualization of radar precipitation forecasts vs observations
